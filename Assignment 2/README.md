# Assignment 2

## Overview
This is the second assignment for DNP-1.  
It builds directly upon the work from Assignment 1, reusing the same domain model and repository structure, while preparing the foundation for new functionality.

## Structure
- `Server/`
  - `Entities/` — domain model classes (e.g., User, Post, Comment)
  - `InMemoryRepositories/` — in-memory data storage implementations
  - `RepositoryContracts/` — repository interfaces
  
- `Assignment_2.sln` — solution file for the assignment

## How to Build
```bash
dotnet build Assignment_2.sln
